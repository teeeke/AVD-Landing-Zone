# Purpose: Provider and Terraform version constraints for the bootstrap layer.
# Section: PROMPT.md §2 — Bootstrap (OIDC, state backend, providers)
# Last updated: 2026-06-10
#
# This root module uses LOCAL state (DECISIONS.md ADR-0002): it creates the remote-state
# backend, so it cannot itself depend on it. Run once, manually:
#   terraform init && terraform apply -var-file=terraform.tfvars
# After apply, paste the outputs into envs/<env>.backend.hcl and the GitHub repo variables.
#
# Versions mirror the validated sibling repo (Azure-Architecture). Confirm/bump against the
# Terraform Registry before a production run.
